# EasyTimeSheetApp
Application made for a university project. 

This application can be used for employees to clock in and out of work.
An employee can clock in/out using their unique code or by scanning their QR code which is generated for them.
There is an admin account which can manage employees and see what hours they have worked for a time period.
